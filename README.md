# weather_predictioin_machine_learning_dusseldorf
Weather Prediction Machine Learning Model for Dusseldorf, Germany


This is a small prediction project focuses on predicting weather conditions in Düsseldorf using machine learning techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, visualizations and evaluation. The goal is to build an accurate predictive model that forecasts temperature and other weather-related variables.


The dataset used in this project consists of historical weather data from Düsseldorf. The dataset includes various weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. The data was sourced from (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/) and is preprocessed for analysis.

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The dataset is loaded and cleaned, handling missing values and formatting the data appropriately for analysis.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations and summary statistics are used to understand the data distribution, trends, and relationships.

3. Modeling:
Several machine learning models, including linear regression and ensemble methods, are trained and evaluated.

4. Backtesting:
Models are backtested using cross-validation techniques to assess their performance over time.

5.Evaluation:
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Results
The best-performing model achieved an MSE of X on the test set. The model successfully captured seasonal trends and provided accurate predictions for temperature and other weather variables.
